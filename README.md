# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:
As a data analyst at PyBer Inc., our team was requested to analyze the company's rideshare data for year 2019. This readme file will walk you through a summary of the analysis as well as the visualizations that we prepared to depict the weekly total fares for different city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural).

## Analysis Results:

As shown in the summary Table below, the total number of rides and number of drivers and the total fare collected is highest for Urban cities followed by Suburban cities and then by Rural cities. On the other hand, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the opposite. This helps us understand the supply-to-demand effect on ride costs.

Part of the analysis was targeted towards finding trends in total fare by city type for each week of the first trimester of the year. It seems from the line chart below that there is no clear upward or downward trend in total fare for different city types. However, it is noticeable that third week of February and the last week of March had the highest peaks during this period.

## Summary: 

Based on the analysis results, our team concluded the following three recommendations for addressing the disparities among the city types:

- There seems to be higher demand-to-supply ratio in rural cities which can benefit from increase in number of drivers. Our recommendation is to find new incentives for people to drive with PyBer in these cities.

- Compared to rural cities, the total number of rides per driver in urban cities is very low. We have bigger competitors in the urban city markets which might be reason behind this. Our team recommends to raise the marketing budget for the next year and reevaluate the analysis to see if can compete in larger markets. 

- On the same issue in the second bullet, our team recommends that we test the sensitivity of fare cost to ridership. Urban cities are showing extremely lower ridership-to-driver ratios than in suburban and rural cities. Cost of the trip might be the reason why riders are opting other ridership companies.
